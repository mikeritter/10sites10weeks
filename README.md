# 10 Sites in 10 Weeks

Create 10 Websites in 10 Weeks

This is an exercise inspired by [Study Web Development](https://studywebdevelopment.com/freelancing.html) and [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to get the ball rolling on a robust, attention-getting, contract-landing portfolio. Many developers have ideas for websites but put off building them. This ten-week challenge is designed to bring those ideas to life in a stretch of projects focused on publishing minimally-viable products, mastering process, and building momentum for a successful freelancing career.

I'm indebted to:

- Burt Petrescue, who got me  started on web development twenty years ago
- Jeffrey Way, whose [laracasts](https://laracasts.com/) showed me what it takes to become an artisan developer
- Quincy Larson, whose [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/about/) has filled in holes I've missed through the years

and countless other framework developers, tutorial producers, and community members whose curiosity and determination make web development an exciting and challenging evdeavor.
