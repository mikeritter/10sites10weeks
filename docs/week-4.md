# WEEK FOUR

## OBJECTIVE: Build a basic five-page website

_Note: how and what you build is up to you. Tailor this challenge to suit your needs._

This is the largets project yet: a five-page website suitable for most clients. Websites serve different functions for different clients, but the essential functions of most websites are:

1. Provide general information to the public
2. Promote services offered
3. Provide support to patrons
4. Direct visitors to locations where business is done
5. Provide opportunities for visitors to communicate

These essential functions provide the structure for most websites. While terminology and complexity will vary from industry to industry and client to client, building a strong familiarity with this five-page website model will serve you well.

## KEY CONCEPTS

### SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION

As you build your pages, identify a key phrase and supporting ideas for each page which you will use throughout the content, including headlines and image descriptions.

### ACTION-ORIENTED LANGUAGE

Build each page with a call to action which you expect visitors to follow. Repeat your call to action throughout each page.

### CROSS-LINKING

Add hyperlinks throughout your site to other pages within your site and popular pages outside your site to improve the search engine performance of your website. This is also great for keeping visitors engaged with your entire site, not just one or two pages.

## TIPS

1. Flesh out your website from an existing template or a set of common layouts that work well together.
2. Think about how your pages can direct visitors to other pages on your website.
3. Be sure to add unique metadata to each page so they can be indexed more specifically by search engines.

## LOOKING AHEAD

This might be  the most intense project of these ten weeks.

It is easy to fall behind or get overwhelmed.

Pace yourself, knowing next week you can build upon the tools you are working out along the way to catch up.
