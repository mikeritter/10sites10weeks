# WEEK FIVE

## OBJECTIVE: Build a fan page

Think of something or someone you are _fanatic_ about.

Fan pages and tribute pages are very popular on the web. When you design a fan page / site to rank well among search engines and fill it with targeted, relevant content, you can _monetize_ it with ads or product links to start generating revenue.

Keep in mind copyright laws. Avoid using images or copying content froom other websites without proper permission or attribution. Look for public domain images or generate your own.

Be sure to add your own unique perspective to your fan page to make it stand out even more.

## KEY CONCEPTS

### MARKET RESEARCH

An important part of successful branding is finding a way to make your site stand out from similar websites. By surveying related websites you can identify common themes, weaknesses, and missed opportunities. Take advantage of this research to build your own website.

### COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT

Plagarism and copyright infringement are rampant among websites. Some search engines penalize websites that contain copied material. Content creators have sucessfully sued websites for stealing their intellectual property leading to take down orders and fines.

Demonstrate your ability to spot and  avoid this hazard.

### MONETIZATION

When you track your visits with tools like Google Analytics and prove your website's performance you can add advertisement blocks or other avenues to generate revenue.

## TIPS

1. Have __FUN__ with this project. The idea is to reward yourself for your hard work so far. Indulge your obsession. Focus that energy into something productive.
2. As a portfolio piece, you may want to make sure your fan page is not going to turn off potential clients.
3. Add an analytics plugin from the start so you can track visits over time.

## LOOKING AHEAD

Don't get this confused with next week's pasion project / cause website. A fan page is typically built around a personality, artist, team, or brand.
