# Week 0

Week ZERO is the time to line up our next ten weeks for a successful stretch.

## My Tips

### Manage Expectations

Your goal is to produce ten minimally-viable products in ten weeks, not to launch the next multi-million-dollar tech phenom. Let go of the pressure.  It won't be easy, but it will be FUN!

Get behind? That's a great opportunity to practice practical project management to get back on track.

Get ahead? Take time to master your technique to add feature requests, file issues, and tackle some prep for your upcoming projects.

Hit a wall? Pivot to another project in your queue. Working in another project might free your mind to ruminate on the problem.

### Master Your Tools

Get to know your toolkit over the next ten weeks. Your toolkit is the suite of software and hardware you use in your practice.

#### Editor

With so many editors out there each developer has their favorite. The industry standard is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is a good choice even if you use another because many shops expect some familiarity with it.

#### Framework

It is good to know a couple frameworks or tech stacks and demonstrate them in your portfolio. While _you_ may like the latest compiler _your market_ may require proficeincy with a web builder or content management system. If your goal is to build a business you need to research what your market requires and work in that.

#### Stack

Now is not necessarily the time to learn a new language. You want to demonstrate what you know. If you are an ECMA master spin up some sweet JavaScript projects, HTML / CSS practitioners demonstrate how you build highly-performant and visually-compelling websites, builder-based designers find the component libraries and layouts that get results.

#### Deployment

Get a feel for deploying your project to the web. Don't let your project sit on your computer. Deploy early and deploy often. Learn how to build, test, preview and push your projects to production. When you mess up,learn how to roll back your changes. Get to know your options for hosting. Tweak your projects to perform.

#### Style

Understand your style. When you understand _how_ you work you know your niche. If you're a bread-and-butter Bootstrap person or a slice-and-dice Photoshop afficianado master your go-to libraries and component models for quicker turnaround. Get a feel for your sweet spot then work in it.

#### Machine

Get a feel for your machine. A thirteen-inch MacBook or multi-display desktop--whatever you develop on--get a feel for its possibilities and limitations, work through the pain points, discover your optimal setup.

### Meet A Need

Each of your projects should meet a need. This isn't some throw-away exercise in which you'll use _lorem ipsum_ as filler and random stock images. Take each project seriously as you want this website to perform. If you can grab a few clients then have at it! Otherwise, make your websites for the public to visit, view, and engage.

### Make Your Plan

This is not a time to wing it. Take advantage of this week to draft your plan. You can begin with pen and paper to work out your ideas. If you use a planner feel free to put this there.

Depending on your toolset you'll need an appropriate project management tool. [Github](https://github.com/features) and [Bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-the-issue-tracker/) are repositories that offer tools that will support your solutions for years to come. They include issue trackers and feature requests. [Trello](https://trello.com/mikeritter17/recommend) is a cusomizable board for moing tasks along a path.

Keep your plan in the sweet spot: enough details to keep you on track, open to  flexibility as you master your workflow.
