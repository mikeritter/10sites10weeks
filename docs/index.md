# TEN WEBSITES IN TEN WEEKS

This is a challenge to kickstart your freelance business or job search in web design and development.

It is inspired by [The Complete Freelancing Bundle](https://studywebdevelopment.com/freelancing.html) and [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I highly recommend both resources to starting freelance web developers, web designers and online marketing consultants.

The ten-week challenge is flexible enough to adapt to anyone in the field.

The key objective is to master your process and toolset while building ten minimally-viable products to form the groundwork for your future projects.

[The Complete Freelancing Bundle](https://studywebdevelopment.com/freelancing.html) lays out an __excellent__ set of essential projects to build. Feel free to follow Kyle's roadmap to get started with some revenue generators.

The following outline is my roadmap designed for projects to build upon each other incrementally and end up with an integrated business-building system that establishes my credibility, produces fresh content featuring my work, and results in business.
