# WEEK 2

## OBJECTIVE: Build your professional blog

Now that you've built a portfolio site to showcase your work, you are going to create a blog. Your blog is going to be a practical resource to demonstrate  your understanding and proficency in your field. Additionally, if your blog is separate from your portfolio you can link to your portfolio and improve search engine scores.

## KEY CONCEPTS

### CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

From full-featured solutions like WordPress to nuts-and-bolts tools like static site generators, the world of content management systems is diverse as the people who use them. When you demonstrate how to implement, optimize, and customize a CMS you can meet the needs of most customers in the market.

### DESIGN

Don't go with an off-the-shelf theme. If you do choose to work with a theme framework work to master its layout tools and available components. Dig into what does and doesn't work. Play with different layouts for different content types.

### PERFORMANCE

Be sure you measure the performance of your blog across key categories: load time, search engine performance, accessibility, and security. Where you find bottlenecks or obstacles, solve them.

### WRITING

Clear communication is an essential skill for successful freelancers. When you demonstrate your ability to form an idea, lay  out an explanation of it, relate it to your audience, and  tie it into your overall objective,  you stand apart as a professional.

If english is not your first language or your audience speaks another language write in that language. You can even provide content in multiple languages to demonstrate yoour fluency.

## TIPS

1. Pick a platform and host you are willing to stick with and can afford (consider hosts with reseller plans you can market yourself for recurring revenue)
2. Think beyond your standard bloggy layouts to add style elements that reflect your brand.
3. Work out topics and themes that will run throughout your blog. As you build your portfolio you can write articles on your process, challenges  you faced, and decisions you made.
4. Let your first article be  about developing your portfolio site.
