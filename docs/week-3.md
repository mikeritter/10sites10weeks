# WEEK THREE

## OBJECTIVE: Build a landing page

_Note: how and what you build is up to you. Tailor this challenge to suit your needs._

Landing pages are a key component in online marketing. An effective landing page is focused on one thing: _[CONVERSIONS](#conversion-def)_. When you can demonstrate the ability to create effective landing pages you improve your marketability.

This week you will build a landing page that leads to a real goal and track conversions.

## KEY CONCEPTS

Each landing page has a _goal_. The _content_ on the landing page is focused on achieving that goal. A _call to action_ is clearly stated throughout the landing page with at least one _button_ that stands out for visitors to click.

<dfn id="conversion-def">Conversions</dfn> are successful completions of the _call to action_ by visitors.

### CALLS TO ACTION

Whatever your product, your end goal is to convince visitors to _do something_: this is your <dfn>_call to action_</dfn>.

This _call to action_ should be __concise__, __measurable__, and __meaningful__. A link with a vague message like "click here" is __NOT__ a call to action. What do you want your audience to do: "book an appointment", "request a demo", "enter for a chance to win", "subscribe"? Now, _those_ are proper calls to action!

### AUDIENCE TARGETING

Once you have defined your _call to action_ it's time to identify your audience. _<dfn>Personas</dfn>_ are example profiles of real or composite people that reqpresent your target audience. Thoughtfully creating personas is an effective first step to targeting an audience.

Using your _personas_ brainstorm the content and design for a first draft of your landing page. Imagine how they might interact with and respond to your landing page in different scenarios.

### PERSUASIVE WRITING

Try your hand writing persuasive content for your landing page. Keep in mind your target audience and key phrases that support your call to action. This will not only improve your market value for your clients, it will help you effectively communicate with others.

### TRACKING CONVERSIONS

Incorporate tools to track the visits to your website and the number of conversions. The higher this ratio, the more successful your landing page. For this reason, it is not enough just to track the number of conversions.

## TIPS

1. Think of this -- as all of these projects -- as a __beginning__, not a final project. When executed correctly, you can use this landing page for a long time to build an email list, generate extra revenue, promote a cause, or any number of goals.
2. Repeat yourself throughout this project. Repetition helps cement your key  ideas in your audience's mind.
3. Revisit and rework this page regularly to optimize its performsnce.

## LOOKING AHEAD

If you haven't already, you might want to think of potential industry- or client-specific projects for the upcoming weeks. By all means, if you complete these projects for your own efforts you will reap rewards. If, on the other hand, you have the opportunity to earn income or define your niche do not hold back until you finish this challenge.
